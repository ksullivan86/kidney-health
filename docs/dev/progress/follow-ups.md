# Progress: owner follow-ups after v0.3.0 (2026-10-08)

Status: in progress. One PR per item, merged when green, then the working branch
`claude/adoring-sagan-th5swr` is reset to `origin/main`. Order: Phase 0 (docs and config), then the
v0.3.1 batch in `docs/dev/plans/v0.3.1.md`, then the assistant back end. Rules: CLAUDE.md (tests with
every behaviour change, JS twins and vectors, append-only migrations, docs and handbook, no network in
tests).

## Done

* Homelab review 1a + 7: `app.admin backup --dir --keep`, package-public note (PR #7).
* Homelab review 2, 3, 6a: Litestream notes, proxy-container `TRUSTED_PROXIES` row, SSO+MFA
  recommendation (PR #10).
* Homelab review 4: `notes` job in `release.yml` appends the index digest to the GitHub release's
  notes; digest form first in `docs/deployment.md` and the Quadlet unit; `tests/test_deploy.py`
  asserts the job's shape. Verified: `pytest tests/test_deploy.py`, `zizmor --offline`, `shellcheck`
  on the extracted script, a dry run of the script.

* PR #11 merged (release digest).
* Homelab review 5: cluster-neutral base `deploy/k8s` + example overlay `deploy/k8s-overlays/example/`
  (beside the base: kustomize refuses an overlay nested inside its base). Verified: kustomize build
  of both, kubeconform strict (18 resources valid), actionlint, zizmor, `pytest tests/test_deploy.py`.
* AI setup in plain words: "The setup in three questions" in `docs/ai.md`, "How the setup fits
  together" in `handbook/docs/app/ai.md` (the Settings intro copy is left for later).
  Both in one PR (#12, merged 2026-10-08 11:16 UTC).

## In progress

* v0.3.1 item 1 "Not chosen yet": schema step `m008_profile_chosen` (`ckd_stage_set_at`,
  `diabetes_set_at`), `Profile.ckd_stage_chosen` / `diabetes_chosen`, form option + guards, Today
  prompt, mock twin, ARCHITECTURE, handbook first-setup, CHANGELOG, ROADMAP and plan done. Verified:
  full pytest (3429 passed before the rebase onto #12), `node tests/js/run_vectors.mjs`, `node
  --check` on the changed scripts. Next: commit, PR, merge when green. Decision: the API's
  suggested-targets endpoint is unchanged (many API tests and clients call it after saving only a
  weight); the form guards it instead.

## Next (in order)

1. v0.3.1 items 2–6 of `docs/dev/plans/v0.3.1.md`, then the kidney-only profile.

## Commands that reproduce the checks

```
python -m pytest -q tests/test_deploy.py
zizmor --offline .github/workflows/release.yml
python -m pytest -q            # full suite before any app-behaviour PR
node tests/js/run_vectors.mjs  # when server logic with a JS twin changes
```
